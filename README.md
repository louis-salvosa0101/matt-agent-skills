# Louis Salvosa's Agent Skills

A focused fork of [Matt Pocock's Skills for Real Engineers](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), retaining the same behavior for a complete engineering delivery flow.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add louis-salvosa0101/matt-agent-skills
```

Choose the skills and agent harness during installation. Include `setup-skills`.

## Set up a project

Run `/setup-skills` once in each project. Its workflow is unchanged from the upstream setup skill: it configures your issue tracker (GitHub, GitLab, local Markdown, or another documented workflow), triage labels, and domain-document layout.

Local Markdown is supported for solo work. GitHub Issues is also available whenever you want to publish specifications and tickets to your repository.

## Delivery flow

1. `/grill-with-docs` clarifies the change and records durable domain decisions.
2. `/to-spec` turns the settled conversation into a publishable specification.
3. `/to-tickets` breaks the specification into small, blocked vertical slices.
4. `/implement` builds a ticket using `/tdd` and finishes with `/code-review`.
